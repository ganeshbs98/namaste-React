->package.json- is the configuration for npm
it keeps track on what version is installed into our system
->npm- is not node package manager it is just package manager

when we are installing we are installing 2 types of dependencies
1.dev dependencies- generallly require in a development phase/Required only for development (not included in production builds).
2.Normal dependencies-Required for running the app.

Type	Used in Production?	Used in Development?	Installed with npm install?
dependencies	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
devDependencies	❌ No	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
#need google more about this in  google

~(tilde)-it allows only patch version upgrades and more restrictive
^(caret)-it allows both patch and minor version upgrades.

-package-lock.json- it keeps track on what exact version is installed

we should not push node modules into git or production
if we have package.json and packagelock.json we can regenrate the all node modules by using npn install

npx-executing the package.

CDN way is not the prefered way to bring react and react dom into project.

what the things parcel is doing
Parcel-
-dev build
-local server
-HMR=Hot module replcement(means it will autmaticlly refresh and replce the changes done in files)
it is watching all the files ung HMR
-File Watching algorithm-is written in c++.
-Caching-faster builds
-Image Optimization
-Minificaton
-Bundling
-Compress
-Consistent hashing
-Code Splitting
-Differential Bundling
-Diagonstics
-Error handling
-HTTPs
-Tree Shaking-removeing unused Code
-Diff dev and production bundles

bundle is responsible for optimising the app performance.


To create production build you need to use- "npx parcel build index.html"
you will encounter error  becoz in package.json you given main as App.js which is different
so you need to remove that line and  run the command again
